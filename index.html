                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello there! My name is Kayla Wilson. I am currently working towards my masters in 
                    computer science at New Mexico State University. In December of 2023, I graduated with my
                Bachelors in computer science from New Mexico State University as well. In the summer of 2023,
                I had the privledge of interning with FAST Enterprises in Lincoln, Nebraska as an Implementation 
                Consultant. This was my first expereince living away from my hometown in New Mexico and I loved it!</p>
                <p>While getting in my undergraduate, I participated in a program called Google Tech Exchange where
                I was able to learn about programming concepts and professionalism from Google Software Engineers.
                I went on to be a mentor for the Google Tech Exchange program as well. Since starting my undergraduate
                I have also worked for Young Women in Computing, focusing on outreach for K-12 education to bring more 
                awareness and minorities into the field of computer science. Through YWiC I also offer tutoring services
                for other students in computer science at my college and work towards creating a supporite community
                within our department.</p>
                <p>Aside from my professional work, I enjoy playing volleyball, painting, and watching anime. Some of my favorite
                    shows have been Blue Eye Samauri, Banana Fish, My Happy Marriage, Erased, and many others. I have recently been very 
                fond of skincare and having a routine, as it is a form of self-care for myself. </p>
